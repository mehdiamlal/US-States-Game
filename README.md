# US-States-Game
A game that tests how many US states you know.
## How the game works
You input a state in the text field, and if it is a valid US state, the text is shown on the map, above the corrisponding state.
## Libraries
This application was built using the **Turtle Graphics** module, for the GUI aspect, and **Pandas** to manipulate the states coordinates in the .csv file.
